                <div class="descdetailcontainer">
                    <p>Cricket is a bat-and-ball game played between two teams of eleven players on a 
                        field at the centre of which is a 22-yard (20-metre) pitch with a wicket at each 
                        end, each comprising two bails balanced on three stumps. The batting side scores 
                        runs by striking the ball bowled at one of the wickets with the bat and then running 
                        between the wickets, while the bowling and fielding side tries to prevent this 
                        (by preventing the ball from leaving the field, and getting the ball to either wicket) 
                        and dismiss each batter (so they are "out"). Means of dismissal include being bowled, 
                        when the ball hits the stumps and dislodges the bails, and by the fielding side either 
                        catching the ball after it is hit by the bat, but before it hits the ground, or 
                        hitting a wicket with the ball before a batter can cross the crease in front of the 
                        wicket. When ten batters have been dismissed, the innings ends and the teams swap roles. 
                        The game is adjudicated by two umpires, aided by a third umpire and match referee in 
                        international matches. They communicate with two off-field scorers who record the 
                        match's statistical information.

                    <p>Baseball is a bat-and-ball sport played between two teams of nine players each, taking turns batting and 
                        fielding. The game occurs over the course of several plays, with each play generally beginning when a 
                        player on the fielding team, called the pitcher, throws a ball that a player on the batting team, called 
                        the batter, tries to hit with a bat. The objective of the offensive team (batting team) is to hit the ball 
                        into the field of play, away from the other team's players, allowing its players to run the bases, having 
                        them advance counter-clockwise around four bases to score what are called "runs". The objective of the 
                        defensive team (referred to as the fielding team) is to prevent batters from becoming runners, and to prevent 
                        runners' advance around the bases. A run is scored when a runner legally advances around the bases in order 
                        and touches home plate (the place where the player started as a batter).

                        out as many of their players and return to their own half of the court, all without being tackled by the 
                        defenders in 30 seconds. Points are scored for each player tagged by the raider, while the opposing team earns 
                        a point for stopping the raider. Players are taken out of the game if they are touched or tackled, but are 
                        brought back in for each point scored by their team from a tag or a tackle.

                <div class="descdetailcontainer">
                    <p>Kho kho or kho-kho is a traditional Indian sport that dates back to ancient India. It is the second-most popular 
                        traditional tag game in the Indian subcontinent after kabaddi. Kho kho is played on a rectangular court with a 
                        central lane connecting two poles which are at either end of the court. During the game, nine players from the 
                        chasing team (attacking team) are on the field, with eight of them sitting (crouched) in the central lane, while 
                        three runners from the defending team run around the court and try to avoid being touched. Each sitting player 
                        on the chasing team faces the opposite direction of their adjacent teammates. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        At any time, one player on the chasing team (the 'active chaser'/'attacker') may run around the court to attempt 
                        to tag (touch) members of the defending team, with one point scored per tag, and each tagged defender required to 
                        leave the field; however, the active chaser cannot cross the central lane to access the other half of the field, 
                        and can not change direction once they start running toward either pole. The chasing team can get around these 
                        restrictions if the active chaser either switches roles with a sitting teammate (by touching them on the back while 
                        saying "Kho") who is facing the other half of the court and therefore has access to it, or runs to the area behind 
                        either pole and then switches direction/half. Each team has two turns to score and two turns to defend, with each 
                        turn lasting nine minutes. The team that scores the most points by the end of the game wins.

                <div class="descdetailcontainer">
                    <p>Badminton is a racquet sport played using racquets to hit a shuttlecock across a net. Although it may be played with 
                        larger teams, the most common forms of the game are "singles" (with one player per side) and "doubles" (with two 
                        players per side). Badminton is often played as a casual outdoor activity in a yard or on a beach; formal games are 
                        played on a rectangular indoor court. Points are scored by striking the shuttlecock with the racquet and landing it 
                        within the other team's half of the court. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Each side may only strike the shuttlecock once before it passes over the net. Play ends once the shuttlecock has 
                        struck the floor or ground, or if a fault has been called by the umpire, service judge, or (in their absence) the 
                        opposing side.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The shuttlecock is a feathered or (in informal matches) plastic projectile that flies differently from the balls 
                        used in many other sports. In particular, the feathers create much higher drag, causing the shuttlecock to 
                        decelerate more rapidly. Shuttlecocks also have a high top speed compared to the balls in other racquet sports. 
                        The flight of the shuttlecock gives the sport its distinctive nature.

                <div class="descdetailcontainer">
                    <p>Aero Modelling is the art of designing, building and flying miniaturized Aircraft (powered or non-powered). 
                        It is both a hobby and sport; the hobby aspect involves building and assembling model aircraft, and the 
                        sport part involves the flying. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        “Aero Modelling” or “Model Aviation” refers to the building and flying of model aircraft. Model Aircraft 
                        are often scaled-down versions of full-size planes and are either flying or non-flying models of existing 
                        aircraft. They are made using materials such as polystyrene, balsa wood, foam and fiber glass.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The models are either static non-flying models, or flying models, and both have different construction techniques. 
                        “It’s a dream of every human to fly and reach the sky; either in terms of glory or literally. This aspiration to 
                        be in the wind and above all gives thrill and when you can’t do so, you resort to objects and make them fly.” 
                        Through Aero Modelling Club, we offer a unique Learn with Fun educational Hobby of Aero Modelling, prescribed
                        by RK University as a co-curricular activity, which a Student can pursue in other than school hours. Aero 
                        modelling club RK University has been started in Year 2013.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Idea was not only to conceptualize the events of Flying but to facilitate the interested students to recognize 
                        their potential in Designing, Simulating, Fabricating and Flying. This is not alone a hobby but also to recognize 
                        individual potential in case He/She wants to opt his/her carrier in Aero Space Industry.

                    <p>Cricket is a bat-and-ball game played between two teams of eleven players on a field at the centre of which is a 22-yard (20-metre) pitch with a wicket at each end, each comprising two bails balanced on three stumps. The batting side scores runs by striking the ball bowled at one of the wickets with the bat and then running between the wickets, while the bowling and fielding side tries to prevent this (by preventing the ball from leaving the field, and getting the ball to either wicket) and dismiss each batter (so they are "out"). Means of dismissal include being bowled, when the ball hits the stumps and dislodges the bails, and by the fielding side either catching the ball after it is hit by the bat, but before it hits the ground, or hitting a wicket with the ball before a batter can cross the crease in front of the wicket. When ten batters have been dismissed, the innings ends and the teams swap roles. The game is adjudicated by two umpires, aided by a third umpire and match referee in international matches. They communicate with two off-field scorers who record the match's statistical information. </p>
