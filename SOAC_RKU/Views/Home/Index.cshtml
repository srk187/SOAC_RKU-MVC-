                    RKU believes that organizations under the leadership of students can enhance a
                    student’s education by providing additional opportunities beyond the curriculum
                    for personal development and growth. The University also benefits from the variety
                    of services and activities provided by student organizations. RKU plans to
                    initiate and sustain student participation in organizations that are open to
                    all members of the community and whose activities do not interfere with
                    the policies or programs of the University.

                        Cricket is a bat-and-ball game played between two teams of eleven players on a
                        field at the centre of which is a 22-yard (20-metre) pitch with a wicket at each
                        end, each comprising two bails balanced on three stumps. The batting side scores
                        runs by striking the ball bowled at one of the wickets with the bat and then running
                        between the wickets, while the bowling and fielding side tries to prevent this
                        (by preventing the ball from leaving the field, and getting the ball to either wicket)
                        and dismiss each batter (so they are "out"). Means of dismissal include being bowled,
                        when the ball hits the stumps and dislodges the bails, and by the fielding side either
                        catching the ball after it is hit by the bat, but before it hits the ground, or
                        hitting a wicket with the ball before a batter can cross the crease in front of the
                        wicket. When ten batters have been dismissed, the innings ends and the teams swap roles.
                        The game is adjudicated by two umpires, aided by a third umpire and match referee in
                        international matches. They communicate with two off-field scorers who record the
                        match's statistical information.

                        Volleyball is a team sport in which two teams of six players are separated by a net. Each team tries to
                        score points by grounding a ball on the other team's court under organized rules. It has been a part of
                        the official program of the Summer Olympic Games since Tokyo 1964. Beach volleyball was introduced to the
                        programme at the Atlanta 1996 Summer Olympics. The adapted version of volleyball at the Summer Paralympic
                        Games is sitting volleyball.

                        Baseball is a bat-and-ball sport played between two teams of nine players each, taking turns batting and
                        fielding. The game occurs over the course of several plays, with each play generally beginning when a
                        player on the fielding team, called the pitcher, throws a ball that a player on the batting team, called
                        the batter, tries to hit with a bat.
                        <br />
                        The objective of the offensive team (batting team) is to hit the ball
                        into the field of play, away from the other team's players, allowing its players to run the bases, having
                        them advance counter-clockwise around four bases to score what are called "runs". The objective of the
                        defensive team (referred to as the fielding team) is to prevent batters from becoming runners, and to prevent
                        runners' advance around the bases. A run is scored when a runner legally advances around the bases in order
                        and touches home plate (the place where the player started as a batter).

                        Kabaddi is a contact team sport. Played between two teams of seven players, the objective of the game is for a
                        single player on offense, referred to as a "raider", to run into the opposing team's half of the court, touch
                        out as many of their players and return to their own half of the court, all without being tackled by the
                        defenders in 30 seconds.
                        <br />
                        Points are scored for each player tagged by the raider, while the opposing team earns
                        a point for stopping the raider. Players are taken out of the game if they are touched or tackled, but are
                        brought back in for each point scored by their team from a tag or a tackle.

                        Kho kho or kho-kho is a traditional Indian sport that dates back to ancient India. It is the second-most popular
                        traditional tag game in the Indian subcontinent after kabaddi. Kho kho is played on a rectangular court with a
                        central lane connecting two poles which are at either end of the court. During the game, nine players from the
                        chasing team (attacking team) are on the field, with eight of them sitting (crouched) in the central lane, while
                        three runners from the defending team run around the court and try to avoid being touched. Each sitting player
                        on the chasing team faces the opposite direction of their adjacent teammates.
                        <br />
                        At any time, one player on the chasing team (the 'active chaser'/'attacker') may run around the court to attempt
                        to tag (touch) members of the defending team, with one point scored per tag, and each tagged defender required to
                        leave the field; however, the active chaser cannot cross the central lane to access the other half of the field,
                        and can not change direction once they start running toward either pole. The chasing team can get around these
                        restrictions if the active chaser either switches roles with a sitting teammate (by touching them on the back while
                        saying "Kho") who is facing the other half of the court and therefore has access to it, or runs to the area behind
                        either pole and then switches direction/half. Each team has two turns to score and two turns to defend, with each
                        turn lasting nine minutes. The team that scores the most points by the end of the game wins.

                        Badminton is a racquet sport played using racquets to hit a shuttlecock across a net. Although it may be played with
                        larger teams, the most common forms of the game are "singles" (with one player per side) and "doubles" (with two
                        players per side). Badminton is often played as a casual outdoor activity in a yard or on a beach; formal games are
                        played on a rectangular indoor court. Points are scored by striking the shuttlecock with the racquet and landing it
                        within the other team's half of the court.
                        <br />
                        Each side may only strike the shuttlecock once before it passes over the net. Play ends once the shuttlecock has
                        struck the floor or ground, or if a fault has been called by the umpire, service judge, or (in their absence) the
                        opposing side.
                        <br />
                        The shuttlecock is a feathered or (in informal matches) plastic projectile that flies differently from the balls
                        used in many other sports. In particular, the feathers create much higher drag, causing the shuttlecock to
                        decelerate more rapidly. Shuttlecocks also have a high top speed compared to the balls in other racquet sports.
                        The flight of the shuttlecock gives the sport its distinctive nature.

                <h3>Aero Modeling</h3>
                <div class="descdetailcontainer">

                        Aero Modelling is the art of designing, building and flying miniaturized Aircraft (powered or non-powered).
                        It is both a hobby and sport; the hobby aspect involves building and assembling model aircraft, and the
                        sport part involves the flying.
                        <br />
                        “Aero Modelling” or “Model Aviation” refers to the building and flying of model aircraft. Model Aircraft
                        are often scaled-down versions of full-size planes and are either flying or non-flying models of existing
                        aircraft. They are made using materials such as polystyrene, balsa wood, foam and fiber glass.
                        <br />
                        The models are either static non-flying models, or flying models, and both have different construction techniques.
                        “It’s a dream of every human to fly and reach the sky; either in terms of glory or literally. This aspiration to
                        be in the wind and above all gives thrill and when you can’t do so, you resort to objects and make them fly.”
                        Through Aero Modelling Club, we offer a unique Learn with Fun educational Hobby of Aero Modelling, prescribed
                        by RK University as a co-curricular activity, which a Student can pursue in other than school hours. Aero
                        modelling club RK University has been started in Year 2013.
